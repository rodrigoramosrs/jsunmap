`Uncovering the map` 🔍

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)


## Overview 🚀

**jsunmap** is a powerful tool designed to convert JavaScript source map files into source code with additional features. By reading and parsing `.map` files, it extracts information from the de-minified code, reconstructing file structures and code similar to the original. Moreover, it applies regular expressions to gather data for content analysis, aiding in the identification of potentially sensitive information.

## Features 🛠️

- **Source Code Reconstruction:** Generate code structures resembling the original JavaScript source.
- **De-minification:** Extract information from de-minified code to aid in analysis.
- **Regex Analysis:** Apply regular expressions for identifying potentially sensitive data.
- **File Structure Generation:** Reconstruct the file structure based on the information extracted.

## Example 📖

```shell
jsunmap [{FILE_OR_URL_PATH}]
```
